# README FIRST
# 1. Subscribe to https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers
#    (click the Watch button on the homepage > Custom > Issues)
#    and keep this matrix up to date in accordance to related announcements.
#    Timely add new ansible-core versions and consider dropping support
#    and testing against its EOL versions.
# 2. If your collection repository is under the ansible-collections org,
#    please keep in mind that the number of GHA jobs is limited
#    and shared across all the collections in the org.
#    So, focusing on good test coverage of your collection,
#    please avoid testing against unnecessary entities such as
#    ansible-core EOL versions your collection does not support
#    or ansible-core versions that are not EOL yet but not supported by the collection.
# 3. If you don't have unit or integration tests, remove corresponding sections.
# 4. If your collection depends on other collections ensure they are installed,
#    add them to the "test-deps" input.
# 5. For the comprehensive list of the inputs supported by the
#    ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action GitHub Action, see
#    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ansible-test.
# 6. If you want to prevent merging PRs that do not pass all tests,
#    make sure to add the "check" job to your repository branch
#    protection once this workflow is added.
#    It is also possible to tweak which jobs are allowed to fail. See
#    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/alls-green#gotchas for more detail.
# 7. If you need help please ask in #community:ansible.com on Matrix
#    or in bridged #ansible-community on the Libera.Chat IRC channel.
#    See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html
#    for details.
# 8. If your collection is [going to get] included in the Ansible package,
#    it has to adhere to Python compatibility and CI testing requirements described in
#    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/collection_contributors/collection_requirements.html.
